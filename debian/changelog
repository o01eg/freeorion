freeorion (0.4.5~RC1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release candidate.
  * Stop building on architectures which regularly fail to build FreeOrion.
    This includes mips and mipsel. Apparently their auto-builders cannot provide
    enough memory which causes frequent FTBFS and there is no indication that
    the situation will improve in the near future.
  * debian/rules: Remove mips, mipsel and sparc from WEAK_HOSTS.
  * Update get-orig-source target.

freeorion (0.4.4+git20150327-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream git snapshot.
    - OIS and Ogre are gone and were replaced by SDL2.
      Remove all references to them. OISInput.cfg is no longer required and can
      be safely removed. This should also fix keyboard issues with OIS. See
      #730405 for reference.
  * Update debian/copyright for new release. Change Source field.
    The FreeOrion project moved to GitHub.
  * debian/rules:

    - Drop libbullet-dev, libltdl-dev, libois-dev and libogre-dev from
      Build-Depends. They are obsolete now.
    - Add libsdl2-dev and libglew-dev to Build-Depends.
    - Vcs-Browser: Switch to cgit.
    - Try architecture:any for this release again.
  * Update debian/watch for new github address.

freeorion (0.4.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 0.4.4 r7640.
  * Remove mips and mipsel from Architecture field.
    Although FreeOrion should be able to compile on mips and mipsel, it
    regularly FTBFS due to the lack of virtual memory on the buildd. Requests
    for help remained unanswered on debian-mips. As long as the situation does
    not change these architectures won't be supported anymore.
  * debian/rules: Delete DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH and DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE variable.
  * Update FreeOrion man page for version 0.4.4.

 -- Markus Koschany <apo@gambaru.de>  Thu, 04 Sep 2014 19:47:41 +0200

  * New upstream release candidate 0.4.4 RC2.
  * Update version-string.patch and REV variable in debian/rules to 7504.
  * Add ConditionParser2.patch cherry-picked from upstream trunk r7533:
    - Break enqueued condition parser into 4 sub-parsers to hopefully help
      compile by reducing memory usage on mips and mipsel.

 -- Markus Koschany <apo@gambaru.de>  Thu, 21 Aug 2014 12:43:54 +0200

freeorion (0.4.4~svn7431-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream snapshot.
  * freeorion-data.links: Adjust the path to DejaVu fonts and point to the new
    fonts-dejavu package.
  * Update get-orig-source target.
    - Do not remove FindBullet.cmake anymore since it has been removed upstream.
  * Build with MinSizeRel and max-parallel=1 on armel, armhf, mips and mipsel
    again. Readd WEAK_HOSTS and -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE options. Apparently Debian's
    buildd are currently not able to cope with FreeOrion's default compiler
    options on a regular basis.
  * Update version string patch to version 7394.
  * Add Forwarded header to GG-verbose-makefile.patch.

 -- Markus Koschany <apo@gambaru.de>  Wed, 06 Aug 2014 22:31:55 +0200

freeorion (0.4.3+svn7114-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upload to unstable.
  * FreeOrion depends on Ogre 1.9 now. (Closes: #732721)
  * Fix dpkg-shlibdeps warning.
     - Update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable again.
  * Remove WEAK_HOSTS conditionals.
     - Build with default values on all arches again since FreeOrion is now
       able to build on armel, armhf and mips. If this proves not to be
       successful, compiling with MinSizeRel is still an alternative.
  * Install ogre_plugins.cfg with arch-dependent package.
     - ogre_plugins.cfg must be installed with the arch-dependent package
       otherwise the game won't start for all architectures except the one
       that built the -data package.
  * Use dh_install --fail-missing to detect uninstalled files.

  [ Markus Koschany ]
  * New upstream snapshot.
  * Remove powerpc64, sparc64, sh4, x32, powerpcspe, arm64 and hppa from
    WEAK_HOSTS.
    - These hosts should be able to compile freeorion with RelWithDebInfo.
  * Update get-orig-source target for r7114.
  * Drop the following patches. They were merged upstream.
    - omit-ADOBE_NO_DOCUMENTATION-check.patch
    - omit-endianness-and-size-checks.patch
  * Update freeorion.install for new release.
  * Update freeorion-data.install for new release.
  * Remove subversion from Build-Depends to reduce the probability of build
    failures.
  * Use icons provided by upstream:
    - Do not convert FreeOrion.ico anymore.
    - Convert only the 32x32 icon to the xpm format due to compatibility reasons
      with older window managers.
  * wrap-and-sort -sa.
  * Switch to Ogre 1.9.
  * debian/rules:
    - Update LD_LIBRARY_PATH for new release.
    - Set CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON.
    - Use -S option of dpkg-parsechangelog. Build-Depend on dpkg-dev (>= 1.17).
  * Update freeorion wrapper script.
    - Adjust the path to OISInput.cfg.
    - Create ~/.freeorion on first start.
  * Update version-string.patch.
  * Add GG-verbose-makefile.patch again and increase verbosity when building GG.
  * Update freeorion.6 man page for new release.
  * Add Forwarded header to remaining patches.
  * Update copyright years.

freeorion (0.4.3-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules:
    - Remove s390 from WEAK hosts. It is obsolete.
    - Change optimization for WEAK hosts to MinSizeRel.
      This change tries to achieve that the build stops failing on arches such
      as armel, armhf, mips and mipsel by using less optimization. (-Os)
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.5, no changes.
  * Add OISInput-config.patch and copy OISInput.cfg from
    /usr/share/games/freeorion to $HOME/.freeorion. Provide an easy way to
    modify OISInput.cfg for normal users and allow them to adjust the settings
    for mouse and keyboard behaviour. (Closes: #719496)
  * Use a stricter dependency for the data package.
    - Apparently it makes no difference if a >= <= relation or just =
      is used for the data package.
  * Update copyright years.
  * Remove source/options. xz compression is the default now.

 -- Markus Koschany <apo@gambaru.de>  Wed, 26 Mar 2014 07:41:32 +0100

freeorion (0.4.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * [9d92bb3] Build icons in dh_auto_build-indep target.
  * [6fc6bec] Use conditional for MAX parallel jobs.
    - Define WEAK_HOSTS in debian/rules and build only with one process on
      weaker architectures. Use max-parallel=4 on all other architectures. This
      prevents that buildd run out of virtual memory.
  * [0d1ab80] Add omit-ADOBE_NO_DOCUMENTATION-check.patch
    - Fix FTBFS on mips, mipsel, armel, armhf, s390, powerpc and sparc.
  * debian/control:
    - [a7c115f] Move imagemagick to Build-Depends-Indep.
    - [82948af] Depend only on libboost-all-dev again.
      Boost1.54 is now finally the default version.

  * New upstream release.
  * Upload to unstable.
  * [0bb9ae2] debian/copyright: comment about artistic content.
    Enhance the comment about artistic or creative content and add a missing
    paragraph from the COPYING file in FreeOrion/default.
  * [81ba198] Clarify copyright of log4cpp. It is GPL-2.
  * [e44fbe2] debian/control: Drop build-dep libdevil-dev. Not needed.
  * debian/control: Build-depend on libboost1.53-all-dev or libboost-all-dev to
    avoid a FTBFS because of conflicting boost versions.
  * debian/patches:
     - [b86e971] Drop desktop-file.patch. Merged upstream.
     - Rename and refresh display-correct-FreeOrion-version.patch to
       version-string.patch.
     - [1887fd9] Drop GG_verbose_build.patch. Merged upstream.
     - [fcfab2a] Drop spelling.patch. Merged upstream.
     - [b6e6140] Drop GG_unbundle_libltdl.patch.
       The upstream build system can detect system libltdl libraries
       automatically now.
     - [8893994] Drop build-with-libboost1.49.patch.
     - [2772512] Add omit-endianness-and-size-checks.patch. Try to avoid build
       failures on big-endian systems.
  * [b494fd6] debian/rules: Do not override the plugin path for
    ogre_plugins.cfg. The upstream build system detects and inserts the right
    path at build time automatically.
  * [aafccb3] debian/rules: Simplify clean rules and move them to clean file.
  * [eb34bbd] Update dh_auto_configure. It is no longer necessary to build GiGi
    separately.
  * [d78e04e] Install ogre_plugins.cfg to RootDataDir.
    Install ogre_plugins.cfg to /usr/share/games/freeorion instead of
    /usr/lib/freeorion hence we can drop the path_to_cfg.patch and reduce
    Debian specific modifications.
  * [e306777] debian/rules: Update LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    Extend LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that dpkg-shlibdeps is able to find the new shared
    libraries, freeorionparse and freeorioncommon.
  * [700b3f9] Update get-orig-source target and fix sourceforge URL.
  * [4e53b36] Install OISInput.cfg in architecture independent package to
    RootDataDir. OISInput.cfg is not intended to be modified. Placing it in
    /usr/share/games/freeorion is appropriate.
  * [a3e8e58] debian/rules: Remove override for dh_builddeb. xz is the default
    compressor now.
  * [21d8c41] Update debian/watch.
