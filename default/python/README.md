# python directory

Python scripts, while modifiable, may require specific functions which return
an appropriate response to FreeOrion.
For example, turn_events/turn_events.py is a required file and should define
an `execute_turn_events()` function returning a boolean (successful completion).

## Contents

* `AI/` Python code which controls the computer players.  This is a
sub-module of the resource directory and can be changed with the --ai-path flag.
* `auth/` Python code which manages authentication information stored either in a file
or in a database.
* `chat/` Python code which manages chat history stored either in a file or in
a database.
* `common/` Common files for code utilized by both the AI and the server.
* `handlers/` debug and development features, see [handlers/README.md](handlers/README.md)
* `turn_events/` Python scripts that run at the beginning of every turn, and
can trigger events that would be impossible to do purely in FOCS.
* `universe_generation/` Python scripts that get run at the beginning of the
game and create the galaxy. You can customise the galaxy generation by
editing options.py and universe_tables.py, both of which have more information
in comments over there. The latter, specifically, controls which star types,
planet types, planet sizes, and also other content get placed.

# Code style check
Each PR will be checked automatically, but you still can run checks manually.
Fixing all issues are mandatory before merging PR.

We use [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) for code style checks.
Settings for it located in the `tox.ini`.

## Install dependencies

```sh
pip install flake8==3.7.9
```

## Run checks
This script should be run from directory where `tox.ini` located

```sh
cd default/python
flake8
```
